## Open Forge Overview

Open Forge is a platform that makes supporting public goods in the Aptos ecosystem more fun and rewarding. It connects people who want to help with those who are building things, and it lets them earn money from open-source software and content. The platform uses AI to make predictions, community-driven randomness on the blockchain, and gamification to create a unique experience. With Aptos' technology and quick microtransactions, Open Forge makes it easy and engaging to support public goods.
