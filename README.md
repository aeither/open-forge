## Problem Statement

In the blockchain ecosystem, innovative projects often struggle to gain visibility and funding. Existing platforms either favor established projects or use complex voting systems prone to manipulation. Open Forge addresses this by creating a fair, engaging, and gamified approach to project discovery and funding.

## Solution: Open Forge

Open Forge is a gamified community space on the Aptos blockchain that connects builders with backers. It leverages blockchain technology, randomness, and innovative funding mechanisms to support and grow promising projects from any ecosystem.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Faceted Authentication
- Self-custodial wallet support (e.g., Petra, Martian)
- Keyless sign-in with Google authentication
- Aptos Connect account manager integration
- Telegram Mizu Wallet integration (in progress)

### 2. Project Discovery
- Tagged projects for easy navigation
- Random daily spotlight using Aptos' on-chain randomness
- Swipe-to-discover interface (similar to dating apps)

### 3. Smart Funding
- Quick, low-cost transactions on Aptos
- Bonding curves to incentivize early backers

### 4. User Experience
- Intuitive, app-like interface requiring no crypto knowledge
- Near-instant transaction completions
- Telegram mini-app integration via Mizu wallet

### 5. Community Building
- New earning opportunities for project creators
- Community-driven project growth
- Easy access to creators' social profiles

### 6. ANS Integration
- Human-readable names instead of long addresses
