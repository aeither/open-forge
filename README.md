# Open Forge: Revolutionizing Project Discovery and Funding

Open Forge is a gamified community space that connects builders and backers. It uses Aptos blockchain and randomness to help find, support, and grow innovative projects from any ecosystem.

## Problem Statement

In the world of blockchain and beyond, great ideas often get lost in the noise. Current platforms either favor established projects or rely on complex voting systems that can be gamed. What if we could create a fair, engaging, and addictive way to discover and fund projects that combines the best of social media, gamification, and blockchain technology?

## Project Description

Open Forge is an Aptos-based platform that makes finding and funding cool projects fun and fair. It uses bonding curves to reward early backers, creating a rush to support promising ideas. The platform shows projects randomly, giving everyone a fair shot at the spotlight. With no-fuss keyless tech and a Telegram mini-app through Mizu wallet, Open Forge feels as easy as using your favorite social media app, but with the power of blockchain behind it.

## Key Features

### The Most Accessible Authentication Frontend
